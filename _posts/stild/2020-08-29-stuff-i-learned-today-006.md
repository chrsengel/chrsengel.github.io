I spent most of my day reading the Deep Learning Book[^book] further. I just finished the introductory part and am now getting started with Part 1 of Deep Learning. I found a great complementary playlist on YouTube[^playlist] that proved to be extremely useful.

- I found the `timeliner` tool[^timeliner]. The author describes it as 'personal data aggregation utility' that allows you to download all of your precious private data from all major services, like Google, Twitter or Instagram. I tried it out and it does the job!
- I read about the impact of SpaceX's giant satellite clusters[^sat]. Spoiler alert: If you are into Astrophotography, then you will have a hard time in the future.
- I read 'How to use Microsoft Word with git'[^word]. I am solely working on Linux and Google Docs but was always wondering about the possibility of implementing version control. I actually built a simple script a while ago that would simply unpack `.xlsx` files and commit certain files. Unfortunately the setup was too much of a hassle.
- I found the 'Architecture Playbook'[^arch] through a friend. It is basically a couple of standardized approaches for IT architecture. It has tons of great resources,lots of basics but also quite a few things that were completely new to me. It is definitely worth checking it out and I am sure that I will use it in the future.
- I read the 'Ethereum is a Dark Forest' article by Dan Robinson and Georgios Konstantopoulos on Medium[^eth]. It is an exciting story about the attempt to recover user funds from a contract and the inevitable frontrunning by smart bots.
- I read a quite disconcerting Twitter thread about US politics by @BrynnTannehill[^tweet] and even replied to it. It cost me two followers!
