Hi there! Happy to have you here on my blog. As you can see, I mainly write about technology and primarily about things I learned during the day in my ['Stuff I Learned Today'](https://chris-engel.com/categories/stuff-i-learned-today/) series. If you like the content, feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chrsengel), subscribe via [RSS](https://chris-engel.com/feed.xml) or send me an email to chris@chris-engel.com.

The purpose of this blog is to improve my writing skills, share my knowledge and make friends along the way.

# About me

I am currently enrolled in Cyber Security Studies at the University of Aalen, near Stuttgart, Germany. These days I am solely working on my bachelor thesis about "morphing attacks on face recognition systems using generative adversarial networks".

I also founded a company, called **Protor**, that currently provides the [Dethlify](https://dethlify.com) service. Dethlify is a blockchain based service that allows cryptocurrency holders to manage their digital inheritance in a trustless way through a beautiful interface. Check it out!
